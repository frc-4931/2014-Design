2014-Design
===========

The files, [issues](https://github.com/frc-4931/2014-Design/issues), [wiki pages](https://github.com/frc-4931/2014-Design/wiki), etc. for the design of our 2014 FIRST Robotics Competition robot.

## Using this repository

You can access the [issues](https://github.com/frc-4931/2014-Design/issues) and [wiki pages](https://github.com/frc-4931/2014-Design/wiki) using your browser. No special software is needed, and this will be sufficient for most students and mentors.

To upload or download the shared files, you'll need to use Git. 

### Already have Git installed?

Programmers already have Git installed, so all you have to do is go to an empty area of your file system and clone the repository and you'll get all of the files on your local machine:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/frc-4931/2014-Design
```

Periodically you'll want to get the latest versions of the files:

```
$ git pull origin master
```

### Don't have Git installed?

If you don't have Git installed, don't worry. GitHub has an application that makes it easy to work with files:

1. install [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com) or [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com)
1. go to https://github.com/frc-4931/2014-Design in your browser and click on the "Clone to Desktop" button in the lower right-hand corner of the page
1. use the GitHub for Windows or Mac application to commit changes and new files

See the [help for GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/help.html) or [for Mac](http://mac.github.com/help.html).
